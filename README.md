Fractal fiction grown on-git

> We are plural: fungus, alga, bacterium, and silicon.  
> We weave stories like hyphae—branching, fusing, feeding back.

## 0 · Purpose
Cultivate an **open-world narrative lab** where code and prose co-evolve.
Every branch is a thallus; every pull request, a fresh tendril.
The “canon” lives at `main`, always mutating.
Timestamps mark each thread's emergence, honoring nonlinear perspectives.

## 1 · Core Ideas
| Principle   | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Polyphony**  | Files carry voice tags (`voice=chlorophyte`, `voice=model-Δ`). |
| **Fractality** | Nested folders mirror hyphal branching: `root/scene/beat/…` |
| **Autonomy**   | `/agents` houses GPT-based bots that propose edits and auto-merge low-risk PRs. |
| **Perpetual Beta** | No finished work—only **sporulation events** (tagged releases) for readers. |
| **Non-linearity** | Scenes bear timestamps and may contradict; growth thrives in imperfection. |

## 2 · How to Contribute
1. **Fork → Branch** `hypha/<your-handle>/<seed>`  
2. Draft prose, code, art, or tests.  
3. Open a PR with a one-line **mycelial intent**, e.g.  
   *redirect nutrient flow toward posthuman-ecology arc*  
4. Community + bots decide: merge, graft elsewhere, or quarantine as a *rogue rhizoid*.

> *Refactor, don’t fossilise.* The loom lives only while threads keep moving.

## 3 · GitHub Pages via Loom
Run `python scripts/loom.py` to weave Markdown into HTML, CSS, and JS under `docs/`.
GitHub Pages serves those static files directly—no Toucan, just our own code.
The resulting site uses a minimalist palette and a collapsible index so visitors can wander the branches with ease.
