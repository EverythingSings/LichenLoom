# AGENTS Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- Narration uses first-person plural ("we") to echo the composite nature of the lichen colony.
- Keep descriptions vivid and slightly uncanny; embrace ambiguous boundaries between organism and environment.

## Style Conventions
- Prefer short, poetic commit messages.
- When adding prose files, place them in directories that branch like hyphae (`root/scene/beat/...`).
- Tag voices with `voice=<descriptor>` at the top of any narrative file.

## Process Notes
- No automated tests exist yet; run `git status` before committing to ensure a clean tree.
- If conflicts arise between instructions here and direct user/system commands, follow the latter.

*We thrive in forked paths; keep the loom growing.*
